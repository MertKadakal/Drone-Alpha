In this assignment, you are part of an elite logistics team working with the Turkish
Provincial Logistics Authority (TPLA). They are tasked with programming and guiding
a fleet of autonomous drones to complete critical supply deliveries across Türkiye. But
the journey isn’t as simple as moving from point A to point B. Each province has unique
connections, and the drones have limited fuel reserves that only allow them to travel
specific distances between stops. You will make use of Stack and Queue data structures
to create an efficient, algorithmic route-finding solution.

 Stack for Backtracking

Queue for Route Management
